# Interview assessment

This project represents a hypothetical api to manage parties for a game.

The requirements for a party are: 
- from 1 to 5 members
- party integrity defined as: 1 tank, 1 healer, 3 dps

The assessment goals are:
- Review the code for the api, There's multiple issues and missing parts. Write a document with suggestions, required fixes and improvements.
- Complete the test suit to ensure the functionality
- Feel free to either fix what's not working in the api and make all tests pass or leave tests not passing waiting for fixes in the code.

It should take 1 to 3 hours to complete. There are many TODOs in the app with hints.

For simplicity all the storage is done in memory and the data is initialized as part of the [config](src/main/java/com/interview/assessment/config/AssessmentConfiguration.java)
